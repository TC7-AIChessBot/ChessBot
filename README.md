## Introduction

This is a final Project of "Introduce to AI"

### Topic
The goal of this project is to create a Chess Engine (running on top of the python-chess package) which can play at a human-like level.
The engine currently works through the use of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and limited quiescent searching.So in this project we've created a chess game with 4 different levels to help user play and improve their skill.\
	*Level 1 :Minimax with alpha_beta_prunning\
	*Level 2 :dqn self-train\
	*Level 3 :dqn stockfish-train\
	*Level 4 :stockfish\
Project is almost done and if anybody want to suggest any improvements please contact us.
